# Countdown Timer ⏳

A simple yet elegant countdown timer that shows the time remaining until a specific event—in this case, the New Year 2026. This project serves as a practical example for developers to explore HTML, CSS, and JavaScript integration.



## 📜 Description

The **Countdown Timer** displays the remaining days, hours, minutes, and seconds until New Year's Day (January 1, 2026). It includes:
- **HTML** for structuring the content.
- **CSS** for styling the layout and giving it a clean, modern look.
- **JavaScript** for dynamic functionality, updating the countdown in real-time.

This project is an excellent way to understand how to combine these three technologies to create interactive web applications.
